# Boardgame Roulette Website

A Flask Website i make along following [Miguel Grinberg](https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg) "The Flask Mega-Tutorial"

The aim is to have a site where users can have a collection of boardgames, from which they can pick randomly when they
decide to play. It would filter on their collection on the number of players or the lenght of play.

A second objective would be to form group of friends and pick a game across collections.

Last objective would maybe, to have autocompletion/suggestion feature when you want to add a boardgame. Maybe someone already
added this boardgame (like Kingdomino, everybody love Kingdomino) and you don't want to fill out every  other information!


To do: 

* ~~Add a boardgame form~~
* Add a boardgame model
* Migrate/update the db
* Display the collection in a pretty way
* A roulette page
* A roulette function
